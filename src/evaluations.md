### Datacamp Modules (5%, by completion)

The DataCamp modules are mainly to support your work on the problem sets and final project by giving you additional practice prior to our in-class activities. As a result, they will be graded on a “complete” and “incomplete” basis, regardless of how many points you received on the assignment itself. This means that you shouldn’t get stuck partway through, since you can always ask to be shown the answer with a points deduction. Conversely, if the concepts are a review to you, these should be very quick to complete, but if you’d prefer to skip, you can talk to me and I will reapportion the 5% to your problem sets. You will receive full credit for DataCamp modules so long as you complete them by the time your final papers are due.

### Problem Sets (40%; 10% each)

Problem sets will assess your ability to apply the concepts to data that is substantially messier, and problems that are substantially more difficult, than the ones in DataCamp. More details on the problem sets will be provided the week before each is released, but here’s the rough workflow:

1. Access the problem set and data via GitHub or Jhub  
2. Work to produce the following outputs for each problem set:  
   * A raw .ipynb with the code for the problem set  
   * A compiled pdf that displays that code and also answers the written questions. These written questions will involve using some LaTeX syntax for equations and formatting.  
   * When applicable (e.g., part of the problem set is run in script form), a supporting .py file

The problem sets will be graded on both accuracy and programming style. For instance, by our second problem set, you will have learned to write functions. The problem set will be designed to test those concepts and if you revert, for instance, to writing repeated code that could be replaced with a function, points will be deducted even if that inefficient code arrives at the correct answer. A solution key to each problem set will be posted to the Files area on the Canvas after all students have submitted.

### Final Project (35%)

Final projects will be completed in groups of 2-3.  You will work on a project that integrates the concepts we are covering into an applied data science project. The end product will be a final status update presentation, a 8-page scientific report, and a complete GitHub repository. See the “Project Components” page for more information on these outputs.

### In-Class Quizzes (10%; 1% each)

To help you stay engaged and on track with the course materials, there will be short in-class quizzes administered at random during lecture time. Each quiz will be very brief—typically 1–2 multiple-choice, Yes/No, or short-answer questions—and designed to be completed in under 3 minutes. These quizzes are meant to be straightforward checks of understanding rather than high-stakes assessments. More quizzes will be given than needed to reach the 10% grade allocation, so missing one or two will not harm your grade. The goal is to encourage consistent participation and regular review of course content.

### Team Player / Participation (10%)

Data science is a highly collaborative activity in the real world, and you should think of your classmates as resources rather than as competition. We will be using a \#problemset channel in our class Slack for you to ask questions about roadblocks you encounter with the DataCamp activities or on the problem sets.

While I will be answering questions within a window of 24 hours, I encourage you to help each other and answer each other’s questions. Your participation grade will reflect whether you’ve helped your classmates on the forum and your participation in class, which includes:

* Interacting during class, e.g. asking and answering questions  
* Participation in class coding activities in small groups  
* Contributions to your group’s final project
