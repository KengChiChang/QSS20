## Course Description

QSS 20 is a foundational and required course in the Quantitative Social Science curriculum that equips students with computing literacy to conduct social science research in the age of “big data.” The skills students learn in QSS 20 are building blocks for data science applications from research to industry to nonprofits and government. This course builds on students’ introductory programming course and teaches you how to draw meaningful insights from real-world, often messy datasets, so you can help incorporate data into decision-making and analysis. The course will teach students to quickly pick up new methods and find patterns in large-scale data—essential skills given that methods and tools for modern statistical computing develop at a rapid pace, and in real-world data science you sometimes don’t know what tools you need to know until you need to know them.

Our topics will include data wrangling and visualization, including merging datasets and SQL for database manipulation; data extraction via APIs and web-scraping; processing and analyzing text as data; and supervised machine learning. Students will also be exposed to Git/GitHub for version control and reproducibility, the command line for scalable computing, and LaTeX for smart typesetting and collaborative workflows. In addition to introductory coding modules via DataCamp, in-class activities, and problem sets, the course will culminate in a group-based, applied data science project using a real-world dataset with social impact.

## Prerequisites

The course will move fast, cover a lot of material, and require active engagement with applied projects. To ensure your success, students must have taken or received AP credit for COSC 1, ENGS 20, or equivalent (with QSS chair’s permission) in order to enroll. An introductory statistics course is also recommended.

## Learning Objectives

The goal of this course is for students to become the best data scientists at working with social data. Students will be able to do the following in Python:

- Work with and visualize various data structures, in particular DataFrames  
- Write effective and well-documented user-defined functions  
- Write API queries to access and custom-build databases  
- Articulate research questions and answer them through cross-sectional analysis or regression  
- Write SQL queries to pull, aggregate, and summarize data stored in database tables

## Course Sessions

Class meetings will typically consist of a lecture (\~40 minutes) followed by an in-class tutorial, interactive group activity, and occasional quizzes.  In-person attendance is required to get the most out of these group exercises.
