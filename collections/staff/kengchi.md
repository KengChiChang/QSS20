Hey, I'm Keng-Chi! I am an Assistant Professor in Quantitative Social Science at Dartmouth.

I use computational tools, including AI and Large Language Models, to study how technology and media influence politics. My work explores censorship circumvention, online image-sharing behavior, and how short-form video content are recommended by algorithms. I’m fascinated by the ways our digital world is reshaping democracy and the possibilities—and risks—it creates for our social life.

Outside of work, I love hiking, arthouse movies, and cooking Taiwanese food.
