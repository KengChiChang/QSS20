Hey, I'm Keng-Chi! I am a PhD candidate in Political Science 
& MS candidate in Computer Science at UC San Diego. 
My research interests are centered on computational social science, 
with a focus on developing and applying machine learning and 
natural language processing techniques to study social phenomena.

Outside of work, I love hiking, arthouse movies, and cooking Taiwanese food.

I look forward to the quarter and meeting you all!
Feel free to come chat about anything, course related or not.
