Intro: I am a first-year PhD student in political science. 
I am main interests are in the development and application of 
computational methods to study authoritarian politics. 
For example, I developed a new measure of media freedom in autocracies 
based on sentiment analysis and topic modelling applied to news media output.

Off campus, I like hiking, cycling, playing guitar, chess, boardgames and good movies.
