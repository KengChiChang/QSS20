As a result, they will be graded on a \u201ccomplete\u201d and \u201cincomplete\u201d basis, regardless of how many points you received on the assignment itself. This means that you shouldn\u2019t get stuck partway through, since you can always ask to be shown the answer with a points deduction. Conversely, if the concepts are a review to you, these should be very quick to complete, but if you\u2019d prefer to skip, you can talk to me and I will reapportion the 5% to your problem sets. You will receive full credit for DataCamp modules so long as you complete them by the time your final papers are due. Problem Sets (40%; 10% each) \u00b6 Problem sets will assess your ability to apply the concepts to data that is substantially messier, and problems that are substantially more difficult, than the ones in DataCamp. More details on the problem sets will be provided the week before each is released, but here\u2019s the rough workflow: Access the problem set and data via GitHub or Jhub Work to produce the following outputs for each problem set: * A raw .ipynb with the code for the problem set * A compiled pdf that displays that code and also answers the written questions. These written questions will involve using some LaTeX syntax for equations and formatting. * When applicable (e.g., part of the problem set is run in script form), a supporting .py file The problem sets will be graded on both accuracy and programming style. For instance, by our second problem set, you will have learned to write functions. The problem set will be designed to test those concepts and if you revert, for instance, to writing repeated code that could be replaced with a function, points will be deducted even if that inefficient code arrives at the correct answer. A solution key to each problem set will be posted to the Files area on the Canvas after all students have submitted. Final Project (35%) \u00b6 Final projects will be completed in groups of 2-3. You will work on a project that integrates the concepts we are covering into an applied data science project. The end product will be a final status update presentation, a 8-page scientific report, and a complete GitHub repository. See the \u201cProject Components\u201d page for more information on these outputs. In-Class Quizzes (10%; 1% each) \u00b6 To help you stay engaged and on track with the course materials, there will be short in-class quizzes administered at random during lecture time. Each quiz will be very brief\u2014typically 1\u20132 multiple-choice, Yes/No, or short-answer questions\u2014and designed to be completed in under 3 minutes. These quizzes are meant to be straightforward checks of understanding rather than high-stakes assessments. More quizzes will be given than needed to reach the 10% grade allocation, so missing one or two will not harm your grade. The goal is to encourage consistent participation and regular review of course content. Team Player / Participation (10%) \u00b6 Data science is a highly collaborative activity in the real world, and you should think of your classmates as resources rather than as competition. We will be using a #problemset channel in our class Slack for you to ask questions about roadblocks you encounter with the DataCamp activities or on the problem sets. While I will be answering questions within a window of 24 hours, I encourage you to help each other and answer each other\u2019s questions.

This course builds on students\u2019 introductory programming course and teaches you how to draw meaningful insights from real-world, often messy datasets, so you can help incorporate data into decision-making and analysis. The course will teach students to quickly pick up new methods and find patterns in large-scale data\u2014essential skills given that methods and tools for modern statistical computing develop at a rapid pace, and in real-world data science you sometimes don\u2019t know what tools you need to know until you need to know them. Our topics will include data wrangling and visualization, including merging datasets and SQL for database manipulation; data extraction via APIs and web-scraping; processing and analyzing text as data; and supervised machine learning. Students will also be exposed to Git/GitHub for version control and reproducibility, the command line for scalable computing, and LaTeX for smart typesetting and collaborative workflows. In addition to introductory coding modules via DataCamp, in-class activities, and problem sets, the course will culminate in a group-based, applied data science project using a real-world dataset with social impact. Prerequisites \u00b6 The course will move fast, cover a lot of material, and require active engagement with applied projects. To ensure your success, students must have taken or received AP credit for COSC 1, ENGS 20, or equivalent (with QSS chair\u2019s permission) in order to enroll. An introductory statistics course is also recommended. Learning Objectives \u00b6 The goal of this course is for students to become the best data scientists at working with social data. Students will be able to do the following in Python: Work with and visualize various data structures, in particular DataFrames Write effective and well-documented user-defined functions Write API queries to access and custom-build databases Articulate research questions and answer them through cross-sectional analysis or regression Write SQL queries to pull, aggregate, and summarize data stored in database tables Course Sessions \u00b6 Class meetings will typically consist of a lecture (~40 minutes) followed by an in-class tutorial, interactive group activity, and occasional quizzes. In-person attendance is required to get the most out of these group exercises.","title":"\ud83d\udcd2 Course Overview"},{"location":"overview/#course-description","text":"QSS 20 is a foundational and required course in the Quantitative Social Science curriculum that equips students with computing literacy to conduct social science research in the age of \u201cbig data.\u201d The skills students learn in QSS 20 are building blocks for data science applications from research to industry to nonprofits and government.

You will select a data source to investigate, begin with broad questions, and focus on narrowing these down to complete and clearly explain a scientific investigation that applies the programming skills we\u2019ve developed. Your final project will produce three outputs: a status update presentation (on the last day of class), a scientific report (~8 pages), and a GitHub repository. You will also complete two project milestones in the second half of the quarter, for which you\u2019ll be assigned into groups of 2-3 students. You\u2019ll work from a common repository that you\u2019ll be added to, and have push/commit privileges for, when you\u2019re set up on GitHub. Options for working on final projects \u00b6 You will have four options for how you work on the final project, two of which involve forming groups of 2-3 students (we\u2019ll ask you about your preferences later).
