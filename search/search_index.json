As a result, they will be graded on a \u201ccomplete\u201d and \u201cincomplete\u201d basis, regardless of how many points you received on the assignment itself. This means that you shouldn\u2019t get stuck partway through, since you can always ask to be shown the answer with a points deduction. Conversely, if the concepts are a review to you, these should be very quick to complete, but if you\u2019d prefer to skip, you can talk to me and I will reapportion the 5% to your problem sets. You will receive full credit for DataCamp modules so long as you complete them by the time your final papers are due. Problem Sets (40%; 10% each) \u00b6 Problem sets will assess your ability to apply the concepts to data that is substantially messier, and problems that are substantially more difficult, than the ones in DataCamp. More details on the problem sets will be provided the week before each is released, but here\u2019s the rough workflow: Access the problem set and data via GitHub or Jhub Work to produce the following outputs for each problem set: * A raw .ipynb with the code for the problem set * A compiled pdf that displays that code and also answers the written questions. These written questions will involve using some LaTeX syntax for equations and formatting. * When applicable (e.g., part of the problem set is run in script form), a supporting .py file The problem sets will be graded on both accuracy and programming style. For instance, by our second problem set, you will have learned to write functions. The problem set will be designed to test those concepts and if you revert, for instance, to writing repeated code that could be replaced with a function, points will be deducted even if that inefficient code arrives at the correct answer. A solution key to each problem set will be posted to the Files area on the Canvas after all students have submitted. Final Project (35%) \u00b6 Final projects will be completed in groups of 2-3. You will work on a project that integrates the concepts we are covering into an applied data science project. The end product will be a final status update presentation, a 8-page scientific report, and a complete GitHub repository. See the \u201cProject Components\u201d page for more information on these outputs. In-Class Quizzes (10%; 1% each) \u00b6 To help you stay engaged and on track with the course materials, there will be short in-class quizzes administered at random during lecture time.

GitHub no longer allows simple password logins for Git operations, so you must use one of the supported methods: signing in through GitHub Desktop (which manages tokens behind the scenes), using HTTPS with a personal access token, or using SSH keys. Each option provides a secure way to prove your identity to GitHub and enables you to push, pull, and collaborate on code without constantly re-entering credentials. This guide covers three supported methods. Pick one per machine: GitHub Desktop (easiest, no keys/tokens to manage) HTTPS + Personal Access Token (PAT) (simple, CLI-friendly) SSH keys (best for long-term CLI + automation) GitHub Desktop (easiest for beginners) \u00b6 When to use: Beginner-friendly GUI workflow; fast setup for class. What it does: Signs in through the browser and stores credentials securely. Git operations use HTTPS behind the scenes. Steps \u00b6 Install GitHub Desktop : https://desktop.github.com Open the app \u2192 Sign in to GitHub.com \u2192 authorize in the browser. File \u2192 Clone repository (or Repository \u2192 New ). Make commits in Desktop, then Push origin . Verify \u00b6 After pushing, open the repo on GitHub.com and confirm your commit exists. Notes \u00b6 Works great alongside editors like VS Code. If you later use the CLI in the same repo, it typically reuses the stored HTTPS credentials (via the system keychain / Git Credential Manager). HTTPS + Personal Access Token \u00b6 When to use: You want to use the command line without SSH keys. What it does: Uses HTTPS for Git operations; Git stores your token via a credential helper (system keychain on macOS, Git Credential Manager on Windows). Steps \u00b6 Create a Personal Access Token on GitHub Go to GitHub \u2192 Settings \u2192 Developer settings \u2192 Personal access tokens Prefer Fine-grained tokens (scope only the repos you need) For classic tokens, the minimal scope for private repos is usually repo . 2. Make sure your repo remote uses HTTPS : git remote -v # If needed: git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO.git 3. On first git push / git pull , Git will prompt: Username: your GitHub username Password: paste the PAT (not your GitHub password) 4. Git will cache the token via a credential helper: macOS: git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain Windows: git config --global credential.helper manager Linux (GCM optional): git config --global credential.helper store (plain-text) or install GCM. Verify \u00b6 git push No further prompts = token is cached correctly. SSH Keys (recommended for long-term) \u00b6 When to use: Heavier CLI use, scripting, multiple repos; avoids PAT prompts. What it does: Uses public-key cryptography (no passwords). You add your public key to GitHub; your private key stays on your machine. Steps \u00b6 Check for existing keys : ls -al ~/.ssh # Look for id_ed25519 and id_ed25519.pub (preferred) or id_rsa / id_rsa.pub 2. Generate a new key (use Ed25519): ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_email@example.com\" # Press Enter to accept default path; add a passphrase for security 3. Start and load into ssh-agent macOS / Linux: eval \" $( ssh-agent -s ) \" ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 * Windows (Git Bash / PowerShell, OpenSSH Agent running): eval \" $( ssh-agent -s ) \" ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 4. Add the public key to GitHub pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub # macOS # or: clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub # Windows (PowerShell) # or: cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | xclip -selection clipboard # Linux GitHub \u2192 Settings \u2192 SSH and GPG keys \u2192 New SSH key \u2192 paste. 5. Switch the repo remote to SSH : git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO.git 6. Test the connection : ssh -T git@github.com # Expect: \"Hi USERNAME! You've successfully authenticated...\" Verify \u00b6 git push No username/password prompts = SSH is working. Choosing and Switching Methods \u00b6 One method per machine is usually enough. Switch HTTPS \u2194 SSH by changing the remote: # To HTTPS: git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO.git # To SSH: git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO.git Quick Pros & Cons \u00b6 Method Pros Cons GitHub Desktop (HTTPS) Fastest start; no keys/tokens; GUI workflow Less scriptable; relies on Desktop HTTPS + PAT Simple on CLI; easy rotation Token prompts (first time); token management SSH Keys Smooth CLI; great for automation; no token prompts Setup effort; key management and passphrases Common Troubleshooting \u00b6 \u201cSupport for password authentication was removed\u201d You tried HTTPS with your GitHub password. Use PAT instead (or switch to SSH). Permission denied (publickey) SSH key not added to agent or GitHub. Run ssh-add -l to list loaded keys Add public key to GitHub; ensure remote is SSH. Wrong remote URL Check with git remote -v . If it\u2019s git@github.com:\u2026 you\u2019re on SSH; if it\u2019s https://github.com/\u2026 you\u2019re on HTTPS.

Instead of sticking with the bare-bones defaults provided by your operating system, it\u2019s worth upgrading to a more capable terminal. This not only improves your efficiency but also helps you understand how the command line works\u2014a critical skill for debugging and troubleshooting. We\u2019ll tackle these one at a time, starting with Python! Installing Python with Miniforge \u00b6 The first step in setting up your machine for this course is to install both Python and a package manager. Unlike R \u2014where you can simply run install.packages() \u2014Python does not include a built-in package management system. To work with common tools like NumPy, Pandas, or Matplotlib, we need an external manager. In this course, we\u2019ll use conda as the default package manager for Python. Why conda Instead of pip ? \u00b6 Python has two major package managers: pip and conda . pip is popular among software engineers and works well for Python-only libraries. conda , however, is better for data science because it can handle large dependencies and non-Python packages (such as compiled C libraries used by NumPy). Importantly, installing conda also gives you access to pip , so you can use either depending on the situation. Why Miniforge? \u00b6 To install conda , there are three common options: Anaconda Miniconda Miniforge After some experience with all three, I strongly recommend Miniforge. Here\u2019s why: Anaconda comes with Python, conda, and dozens of preinstalled packages. While that sounds convenient, it often causes dependency conflicts once you start adding your own packages. Miniforge is a lighter install\u2014it only includes Python and core utilities like conda and pip\u2014so you start clean and avoid many conflicts. Unlike Miniconda, Miniforge defaults to the conda-forge channel, a community-maintained package repository that is usually the most reliable source for up-to-date libraries. If you already have a conda installation (from Anaconda or Miniconda), you are not actively using right now, it might be a good idea to delete it and start fresh. It\u2019s good practice not to be too attached to your Python installations; sometimes, a clean slate is the easiest way to resolve issues. An Important Note on pyenv \u00b6 Miniforge is a substitute for tools like pyenv or venv . Do not install both. Miniforge\u2019s conda can do everything pyenv can and more, including managing multiple environments. Installation Steps \u00b6 Go to the Miniforge download page . Click the link for your operating system. This will download an installer file. For macOS Users \u00b6 Move the downloaded .sh file to your desktop. Open the Terminal application (you can find it in Applications > Utilities ). In the Terminal, type cd ~/desktop and press Enter . Type bash followed by the name of the downloaded file (e.g., bash Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh ) and press Enter . When asked to review the license agreement, press Enter . Then, type q to exit the text viewer. Type yes and press Enter to accept the license agreement. Press Enter to accept the default installation location. IMPORTANT : At the end of the installation, you\u2019ll be asked, Do you wish to update your shell profile to automatically initialize conda? . You must type yes and press Enter . For Windows Users \u00b6 Run the downloaded .exe file. When asked who to install for, select \u201cJust for me (recommended)\u201d . Accept the default installation location. You\u2019ll see a few checkboxes. Make sure to check the following: Add Miniforge3 to my PATH environment variable (even though it says it\u2019s not recommended). Register Miniforge3 as my default Python 3.12 . It\u2019s also a good idea to check the box to remove the cache. That\u2019s it!
